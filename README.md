## aoc2021-rcc
This is inherited from template for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) contest.

After >40 years writing in-countable lines of code in M*/COS/ISOS (and a bunch of archaic languages)   
I decided for myself to set a **strong signal for the future**. We have **Embedded Python** available   
(still pre-release)! I just felt it as a sacrilege to ignore this excellent **NEW** opportunity and    
stay with the old sermon that I had used for decades.  
**Advent** means time of waiting and preparing for something important to come.  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcemper/ZPretty/master/1star.png)     
So to me, it meant **Advent of Embedded Python Code** that finally showed up in time.  
ALL class methods of 25 exercises + utility are exclusively written using Embedded Python.     
And I'm proud that it ranked as **#3 completed** by registered members of the Developer Community.        

For later use I have added also 
- all full descriptions of the exercises as Day*.md,  
- a snapshot of the private leaderboard at the time of completion of the exercise,
- all test data, exercises input data and alternate exercises input data,         
- result summaries for all Test examples, all Exercises, and all alternate Exercises.
- full compatible to ZPM and therfore also avialable without Docker image    
So you are able to follow in all details.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.   
**ATTENTION:** The Community License of the IRIS preview image expires **12/1/2022**   

### Installation 
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
 git clone https://github.com/isc-at/AoC2021-rcc.git
```
Open the terminal in this directory and build and run the IRIS container with your project:
```
 docker-compose up -d --build
```
iris.script will import everything you place under /src into IRIS.

### How to Test it
Open IRIS terminal:
```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris
USER>do ##class(dc.aoc2021.Day1).Run()
```
- Extended Run parameters:  _do ##class(dc.aoc2021.Day3).Run(**part,test**)_ with    
part =  1,2 ; run only first or second part of example, anything else = both    
test = 0 ; use alternate input set     
test = 1..n ; run other tests as provided by example 
````
; to run all exercises use
for day=0:1:25 do $classmethod("dc.aoc2021.Day"_day,"Run")
; to run all alteratete exercises use  test=0
for day=0:1:25 do $classmethod("dc.aoc2021.Day"_day,"Run",,0)
; to run all first test examples use
for day=0:1:25 do $classmethod("dc.aoc2021.Day"_day,"Run",,1)
; to run ALL this with just one line
for day=0:1:25 for test=-1:1:1 do $classmethod("dc.aoc2021.Day"_day,"Run",,test)
````
Some exercises have more then 1 example:   
Day8:2, Day12:3, Day16:15, Day18:10, Day22:3, Day24:none 
````
; to run all test examlpes of day 16
for example=1:1:15 do ##class(dc.aoc2021.Day16).Run(,example)
````
Files <repo>/data/ALL*.txt hold all available results
